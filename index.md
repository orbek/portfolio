Each folder includes detailed documentation for the respective projects, providing context on the goals and methodologies used.

## About Me
I am a **Database Manager and Report Analyst** currently working at Miami Dade College, where I oversee data analysis and reporting for the School of Science. I also serve as an **Adjunct Faculty** member at Miami Dade College, teaching classes in Intro to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am responsible for designing and maintaining SQL databases, automating data processes with Python and Power Automate, and creating Power BI dashboards for decision-making. Additionally, I work with nonprofit organizations like the Belafonte Tacolcy Center to enhance data-driven strategies for client outreach and grant effectiveness.

### Professional Skills:
- **Data Analytics**: SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Python
- **Database Management**: Azure SQL, AWS RDS (MySQL), Oracle
- **Automation**: Power Automate, Python Scripting
- **Project Management**: Leading data collection and reporting initiatives for academic departments and nonprofits

## Featured Projects
1. **Power BI Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards focusing on academic performance metrics, cohort analysis, and retention trends.
2. **Python Automation Scripts**: Python projects designed to automate data processing, including scheduled tasks integrated with SQL databases.
3. **Database Development**: Database solutions created in Azure SQL and AWS RDS, supporting student and nonprofit data tracking.
4. **Financial Planner App**: Personal finance manager for income, expenses, and bank statement extraction with Google Gemini and Supabase integration.

## Projects and Papers

### 1. [Disney Internship Project](https://github.com/orbek/DisneyIntership)
This project was developed as part of the selection process for a Disney internship. It uses the **Streamlit** framework in Python to train a **Logistic Regression** machine learning model on historical data. The model predicts clients likely to abstain from purchases in the upcoming month, helping the marketing team target their campaigns and increase revenue.

**Features:**
- Logistic regression model to predict future purchases
- Upload CSV files to train the model and predict results
- Export processed data for reporting

### 2. Tutors Track
**Tutors Track** is a web application built with the **Streamlit** framework, hosted on **Azure Web App**, and connected to an **Azure SQL Server**. The application is designed for internal use, allowing students to track participants in tutoring sessions and manage attendance for classes or general events. It also includes an admin page for managing tutors, class codes, and generating reports.

> **Note:** This is a private repository containing proprietary code developed for internal institutional use.

**Features:**
- Attendance tracking for tutoring sessions and events
- Admin dashboard to manage tutors, class codes, and generate reports
- Microservices architecture using **Azure Functions** to handle database requests, improving speed and reliability
- Hosted on **Azure Web App** and connected to **Azure SQL Server** for secure, cloud-based data management
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Automated reporting and data visualization

### 3. [Ethics in Cybersecurity – Legal Framework Analysis](https://github.com/orbek/portfolio/blob/main/papers/Ethics%20in%20Cybersecurity%20-%20Legal%20Framework%20Analysis.pdf)
This paper offers a **comparative analysis** of two major international data privacy laws: the **European Union’s GDPR** and **Brazil’s LGPD**. It was developed as part of an **Ethics in Cybersecurity** course at Miami Dade College and demonstrates my ability to critically evaluate legal frameworks in cybersecurity and data protection.

**Highlights:**
- Comprehensive overview of GDPR and LGPD principles, rights, and enforcement mechanisms
- Detailed side-by-side comparison table
- Discussion of responsibilities for cybersecurity professionals regarding compliance and incident response
- Real-world enforcement cases illustrating practical applications
- Final reflections on global trends in data protection and privacy

### 4. [Deep Learning – Analyzing the Behavior of an Imitation-Based Agent](https://github.com/orbek/portfolio/blob/main/papers/Deep%20Learning%20-%20Analyzing%20the%20Behavior%20of%20an%20Imitation-Based%20Agent.pdf)
This project explores the application of **imitation learning** to develop an AI agent capable of replicating expert gameplay strategies within a simulated ice hockey environment using **SuperTuxKart**.

**Highlights:**
- Developed multiple deep learning models (Model A, B, and C) to predict an expert agent’s behavior
- Focused on feature engineering, model training, and fine-tuning (learning rate adjustments, kart type analysis)
- Achieved significant performance improvements through model architecture refinement and strategic data preparation
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning for decision-making in dynamic simulated environments

### 5. [Mitigating Dataset Artifacts Through Fine Tuning and Ensemble-Based Training](https://github.com/orbek/portfolio/blob/main/papers/Mitigating%20Dataset%20Artifacts%20Through%20Fine%20Tuning%20and%20Ensemble-Based%20Training.pdf)
This paper investigates the robustness of the **ELECTRA-small** transformer model in Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks. Developed during my **Natural Language Processing** course, the work explores fine-tuning techniques and ensemble-based strategies to address dataset artifacts and improve model generalization.

**Highlights:**
- Fine-tuned ELECTRA on contrastive and adversarial datasets to expose model weaknesses
- Developed an ensemble-based training method for better handling of linguistic artifacts
- Detailed evaluation of model performance using accuracy and F1 scores
- Insights into improving robustness and reliability of NLI models

### 6. [Failure Analysis of Terminal Port Assets in Vila Velha (TVV)](https://github.com/orbek/portfolio/blob/main/papers/Portuguese%20-%20Analise%20de%20Falha%20dos%20Ativos%20do%20Terminal%20Portuario%20de%20Vila%20Velha.pdf)
This article, written in Portuguese, was my **undergraduate capstone project** in Industrial Engineering. It analyzes the root causes of equipment failures at the Vila Velha Port Terminal and proposes a corrective action plan using quality management tools to increase asset availability and reduce unplanned downtime.

**Highlights:**
- Practical application of quality tools: Pareto chart, Cause-and-Effect diagram, Stratification
- Calculation of Key Performance Indicators such as MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), and Availability
- Identification of recurring failure modes in components like joystick and engine
- Action plan to enhance operational efficiency and reliability

### 7. [Financial Planner – Personal Finance Tracker](https://github.com/orbek/financial-planner)
