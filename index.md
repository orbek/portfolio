# Data Science & Analytics Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository, where I showcase my work across various programming languages and data analysis tools. This repository is organized into folders based on the tools and software I use regularly in my professional work.

## Repository Structure
- **[Power BI](https://github.com/orbek/portfolio/tree/main/Power%20BI)**: This folder contains projects and reports created in Power BI, showcasing my ability to develop insightful and interactive dashboards.
- **[Python](https://github.com/orbek/portfolio/tree/main/Python)**: This folder contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data wrangling, analysis, and automation.

Each folder includes detailed documentation for the respective projects, providing context on the goals and methodologies used.

## About Me
I am a **Database Manager and Report Analyst** currently working at Miami Dade College, where I oversee data analysis and reporting for the School of Science. I am responsible for designing and maintaining SQL databases, automating data processes with Python and Power Automate, and creating Power BI for decision-making. I also work with nonprofit organizations like the Belafonte Tacolcy Center to enhance data-driven strategies for client outreach and grant effectiveness.

### Professional Skills:
- **Data Analytics**: SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Python
- **Database Management**: Azure SQL, AWS RDS (MySQL), Oracle
- **Automation**: Power Automate, Python Scripting
- **Project Management**: Leading data collection and reporting initiatives for academic departments and nonprofits

## Featured Projects
1. **Power BI Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards focusing on academic performance metrics, cohort analysis, and retention trends.
2. **Python Automation Scripts**: Python projects designed to automate data processing, including scheduled tasks integrated with SQL databases.
3. **Database Development**: Database solutions created in Azure SQL and AWS RDS, supporting student and nonprofit data tracking.

## App Projects

### 1. [Disney Internship Project](https://github.com/orbek/DisneyIntership)
This project was developed as part of the selection process for a Disney internship. It uses the **Streamlit** framework in Python to train a **Logistic Regression** machine learning model on historical data. The model predicts clients likely to abstain from purchases in the upcoming month, helping the marketing team target their campaigns and increase revenue. 

**Features:**
- Logistic regression model to predict future purchases
- Upload CSV files to train the model and predict results
- Export processed data for reporting

### 2. [Tutors Track](https://github.com/orbek/Tutors_track)
**Tutors Track** is a web application built with the **Streamlit** framework, hosted on **Azure Web App**, and connected to an **Azure SQL Server**. The application is designed for internal use, allowing students to track participants in tutoring sessions and manage attendance for classes or general events. It also includes an admin page for managing tutors, class codes, and generating reports.

**Features:**
- Attendance tracking for tutoring sessions and events
- Admin dashboard to manage tutors, class codes, and generate reports
- Hosted on **Azure Web App** and connected to **Azure SQL Server** for secure, cloud-based data management
